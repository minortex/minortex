## 💻 About my technology discoveries

- 🔭 **Concentrating：** Gaining a deeper understanding of **GNU/Linux system**, and **Arch Linux** customizing~
- 🌱 **Learning：**
    - **Modern C++ **, for system-level tools and CLI application developing.
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack & Daily Config**:
    - **Operating System**: Arch Linux (main) / Windows 11 LTSC (Game playing)
    - **DE/WM**: KDE Plasma (Wayland)
    - **Shell**: Zsh(Zim + powerlevel10k)
    - **Language**: From Python/Shell To C++ ...(Though not so well in script language)
- 💻 **Workflow**:
    - Implementing pure keyboard-driven control in the terminal.
    - Yet in graphical environments, I compromise with VSCodium and KDE for efficiency and stability.。
- 🤔 **Philosophy**:
    - I live by the KISS principle.
    - though I’ll occasionally bend toward complexity when practicality demands it—like my Arch Linux still running systemd.
    - Striking the balance between efficiency and simplicity is my true pursuit.

## 🤝 Cooperation and Communication

- 💬 **Let's discuss**: About Arch Linux configuration, Embedded system and Modern C++'s language features.
- 🤔 **Seek for help**: Small C++ projects for hands-on practice, Learning resources for Linux system programming, Pls tell me!
- 📫 **Reach me**：Via email.
